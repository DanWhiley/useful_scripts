## BASH one liners. Some are my own, some have been collected from others on the internet to sovle certain issues I have faced and some have been adapted for my use. Use with caution and some will need to be edited for your own needs.

## Split a multi-FASTA into individual FASTA files

awk '/^>/{s=++d".fa"} {print > s}' multi.fa

## Print everything except the first line of the file

awk 'NR>1' input.txt

## Print a range of rows (such as 10-100):

awk 'NR>=10&&NR<=100' input.txt

## Search for specific file of interest anywhere in the current directory. This is useful for programs that output multiple file types. 

find . -name "*.your_file_of_interest"

## Run FASTQC in parallel 12 jobs at a time

find *.fastq | parallel -j 12 "fastqc {} --outdir ."

## move all files from subdirectories to current directory and run a cleanup of the empty directories

find . -type f -mindepth 2 -exec mv -i -- {} . \;

find . -depth -mindepth 1 -type d -empty -exec rmdir {} \;

## Gzip all non-gziped files in a directory an subdirectories 

find . -type f ! -name '*.gz' -exec gzip "{}"\;

## search for a gene of interest in files and output them into a text file

grep -r "gene_name_of_interest_here" | cat >> [File_name_here].txt
